  <h1>middleware</h1>
  <p></p>Middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous
  functions. Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins. Mongoose 4.0 has 2 types of
  middleware: document middleware and query middleware. Document middleware is supported for the following document
  functions.
  
  init
  validate
  save
  remove
  Query middleware is supported for the following Model and Query functions.
  
  count
  find
  findOne
  findOneAndRemove
  findOneAndUpdate
  update
  Both document middleware and query middleware support pre and post hooks.
  
  Pre
  
  There are two types of pre hooks, serial and parallel.
  
  Serial
  
  Serial middleware are executed one after another, when each middleware calls next.
  
  const schema = new Schema(..);
  schema.pre('save', function(next) {
  // do stuff
  next();
  });
  Parallel
  
  Parallel middleware offer more fine-grained flow control.
  
  const schema = new Schema(..);
  
  // `true` means this is a parallel middleware. You **must** specify `true`
  // as the second parameter if you want to use parallel middleware.
  schema.pre('save', true, function(next, done) {
  // calling next kicks off the next middleware in parallel
  next();
  setTimeout(done, 100);
  });
  The hooked method, in this case save, will not be executed until done is called by each middleware.
  
  Post middleware
  
  post middleware are executed after the hooked method and all of its pre middleware have completed. post middleware do
  not directly receive flow control, e.g. no next or done callbacks are passed to it. post hooks are a way to register
  traditional event listeners for these methods.
  
  schema.post('init', function(doc) {
  console.log('%s has been initialized from the db', doc._id);
  });
  schema.post('validate', function(doc) {
  console.log('%s has been validated (but not saved yet)', doc._id);
  });
  schema.post('save', function(doc) {
  console.log('%s has been saved', doc._id);
  });
  schema.post('remove', function(doc) {
  console.log('%s has been removed', doc._id);
  });</p>

  <h1>populate</h1>
  <p>The properties that we want to use .populate() on are properties that have a type of mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId.
  it tells mongoose where to look. The next part of that
  property is the ref. The ref tells Mongoose “Those docs are going to be in the ___ collection.”</p>
